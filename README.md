# ASAM OpenMATERIAL 3D
ASAM OpenMATERIAL 3D has the target to develop a 3D asset exchange format with physical material properties for virtual development, test and validation of automated driving.

The project group discussions led to renaming the standard from "ASAM OpenMATERIAL" to "ASAM OpenMATERIAL 3D" to emphasize that the standard not only covers material properties but also 3D geometry.

## Project origin
This project is a continuation of the [OpenMATERIAL](https://github.com/LudwigFriedmann/OpenMATERIAL/) project at [ASAM e.V.](https://www.asam.net/).
The original repository will be emptied. Only the directory structure will be retained to maintain existing links and references.
A copy of the original repository was created at kick-off of ASAM OpenMATERIAL in February 2024 and can be found in branch [OpenMATERIAL_Legacy](https://github.com/asam-ev/OpenMATERIAL/tree/OpenMATERIAL_Legacy).

## Published version
The standard is still under development. The published HTML reflects the status of the main branch. It can be found here: [ASAM OpenMATERIAL](https://asam-ev.github.io/OpenMATERIAL/asamopenmaterial/latest/specification/index.html).
