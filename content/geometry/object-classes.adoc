= Object classes

== Introduction
In ASAM OpenMATERIAL, an object class is a collection of similar objects.
Examples of object classes are vehicles, humans, and road networks.
Each instance of an object class is described by the same properties, but has
individual property values.

The ASAM OpenMATERIAL standard supports the following object classes:

* xref:../geometry/object-vehicle/vehicle-index.adoc[Vehicle] 
* xref:../geometry/object-human/human-index.adoc[Human] 
* xref:../geometry/object-environment/environment-index.adoc[Environment]

If a human is clearly distinguishable from a vehicle, then both the
human and the vehicle are represented by two different objects. Examples are
bicycles, motorbikes, or scooters, where the human and the vehicle are
perceived as separate entities.
