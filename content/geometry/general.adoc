== Coordinate systems

ASAM OpenMATERIAL uses the following types of coordinate systems:

* World coordinate system, see <<World coordinate system>>
* Local coordinate system, see <<Local coordinate system>>

Both coordinate systems consist of three orthogonal directions associated with
x-, y-, and z-axes, and a coordinate origin where axes meet. The coordinate
systems are right-handed Cartesian coordinate systems according to ISO 8855. For
a non-rotated coordinate system, the following applies:

* Forward matches x-axis
* Left matches y-axis
* Up matches z-axis

The positive rotation is assumed to be counter-clockwise ("right-hand rule").
Orientation of objects is expressed extrinsically by the yaw, pitch, and roll
angles derived from the Euler rotation sequence in the order z-axis, then
y-axis, then x-axis.

<<fig-coo-sys-rotation>> shows the positive axes and positive directions of the
corresponding angles.

<<fig-coo-sys-example>> shows the different states of a coordinate
system with defined rotations. x’/y’/(z’=z) denotes the coordinate system after
rotating x/y/z with the heading angle around the z-axis. The coordinate system
x’’/(y’’=y’)/z’’ denotes the coordinate system after rotating x’/y’/z’ with the
pitch angle around the y’-axis. The final rotated coordinate system
(x’’’=x’’)/y’’’/z’’’ is obtained after rotating system x’’/y’’/z’’ with roll
angle.

Each 3D model has an individual reference frame. Individual nodes of an
object may have local coordinate frames, for example, each wheel of a vehicle.


=== World coordinate system

A coordinate system of type (x, y, z) that is fixed in the inertial reference frame of
the simulation environment has the x~w~- and y~w~-axes parallel to the ground
plane and the z~w~-axis pointing upward.

Neither origin nor orientation of the world coordinate system are defined by the ASAM OpenMATERIAL standard. Nevertheless, the origin of the world coordinate system in an OpenMATERIAL 3D environment should coincide with the origin of a corresponding ASAM OpenDRIVE map (if available).
The origin of the world coordinate system in ASAM OSI should also be aligned with these two coordinate systems.

=== Local coordinate system

Top-most local coordinate frames of 3D assets (so called reference coordinate frames) in OpenMATERIAL are defined in the center of the bounding box of the corresponding asset, projected to the bottom of the bounding box.
By static transformations, these coordinate frames may be synchronized with reference coordinate frames in ASAM OpenSCENARIO and ASAM OSI.
Besides reference coordinate frames, 3D assets may incorporate other local coordinate frames, see xref:../geometry/object-classes.adoc[Object classes].

== Naming conventions

The following naming conventions apply to ASAM OpenMATERIAL geometry files:

* The name of a 3D model file shall have the prefix `omg_` to indicate that the file
complies with the ASAM OpenMATERIAL geometry specification.
* The 3D model file and the related 3D asset file shall have the same base name.

NOTE: Putting more information in file name to be discussed for specific object classes.

== 3D asset file

The 3D asset file provides meta data as well as a mapping table to ASAM OpenMATERIAL material property files.
This information extends the geometry of an asset given in standard 3D model file formats, e.g. glTF, FBX or USD.
The 3D asset file is in JSON format with the file extension `xoma`.
As indicated above, the asset file has to have the same file name as the accompanying 3D model with the prefix `omg` indicating,
that the 3D model file is structured according to the ASAM OpenMATERIAL geometry specification.
This is an example of a 3D model file in glTF format with an accompanying 3D asset file:

* `omg_my-model.glTF`
* `omg_my-model.xoma`

Each 3D asset file contains the following information:

* Metadata
* Material mapping (with possibility to easily change assignment)
* Optional link to another asset file to facilitate instancing (same asset file for different 3D models)
* Semantic information (labels) for sub-meshes ?
* Description of coordinates, pivot points and so on instead of hierarchy in 3D model file ?
* Assigning data streams (for example, wheel rotation) to certain sub-meshes ?

NOTE: TODO: Add short descriptions and references

== Requirements

Materials shall be separated.

NOTE: TODO: Extend rule and find better location. What do you want to express, that two
materials with different properties need to be modeled by separate objects?
Are there any other requirements regarding quality, semantic/animation/material structure?


== Recommendations

* The same texel density should be used within a file. (asset file?)
* For each object class, the recommended mesh resolution should be used.
* To improve performance of vegetation objects, alpha textures should be used.

NOTE: TODO: Move recommendations to descriptive sections, e.g. object class
recommendation to section "Object Class".
