=== Naming convention

Every bone has a unique name and represents a part of the human body. The left and right side of the armature are indicated with the keywords "Left" and "Right" as a postfix.
All included meshes use a keyword as a prefix to indicate which kind of asset it represents. They shall be named meaningful.

If needed, the user is free to add more prefixes or bones, which are not part of the standard, for himself.
