=== Naming convention

Every mesh has a unique name and represents a part of the vehicle. The different vehicle components can be identified by the keywords.
All included meshes use one or more keywords to indicate which kind of asset it represents and where it is located.

Count the wheel index per axle from right to left (in positive y-direction and according to the https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-antora-generator/asamosi/latest/gen/structosi3_1_1MovingObject_1_1VehicleAttributes_1_1WheelData.html#a094de989f5a2aab080f9a65f0feb3867[ASAM OSI definition]).

If needed, the user is free to add more groups and new keywords, which are not part of the standard, for themself.
