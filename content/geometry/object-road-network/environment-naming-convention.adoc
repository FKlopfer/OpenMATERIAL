=== Naming convention

Every asset has a unique name and represents a part of the environment. All included meshes are part of a group to indicate which kind of asset type it represents.
All meshes should be named meaningful.

If needed, the user is free to add more groups and new keywords, which are not part of the standard, for himself.
