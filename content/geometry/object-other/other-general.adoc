The other object class comprises all objects not yet specified by {THIS_STANDARD}.
It includes all objects that aren't specified by type specific object classes.
Definitions in type specific object classes overwrite the specifications in the other object class.

For objects of class other, only the presence of the Grp_Root node is mandatory.
All object components shall be children of Grp_Root.
The associated coordinate system for Grp_Root should have its origin in the geometric center of the object's bounding box, projected to the ground.
The x-axis of the coordinate system should point to the front of the object (if applicable), the z-axis of the object should point vertically upwards and the y-axis should point sidewards to complete the right-hand coordinate system.
