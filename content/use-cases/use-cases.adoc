= Use Cases

////
Use cases in the context of ASAM standards describe the external behavior of the standardized system, that is, the interaction of the system with a user or another system.
The description of use cases is particularly useful for explaining the motivation for:

* New standards
* Development projects for a new major version of a standard
* Development projects for adding features to a minor version of a standard

Use cases are divided in three groups that view the standard from different perspectives.
A project proposal should consider all three perspectives in order to provide a comprehensive overview.

* *Business use cases* describe an economic advantage, a corporate requirement, a process, a method, or an element in a larger tool chain, which involves many people within one company or across multiple companies that have a customer-supplier relationship.

* *End user use cases* describe a requirement, process, method, or element of a tool chain that are handled by users who work with the standard.

* *Technical use cases* describe technical requirements for the operation and interoperability of technical systems, such as tools, test systems, or application software, which the standard supports.

.Moving object parts in the environment simulation
|===
|*Type of use case*         |Technical use case
|*Description*              |As a simulation platform or sensor model developer, I want to move objects as well as individual parts of the objects during simulation runtime. These can be parts of a vehicle, for example, wheels and doors or the skeleton bones of a pedestrian. One option to manipulate the imported _3D assets_ during simulation runtime is using ASAM OSI. In the https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-antora-generator/asamosi/V3.6.0/gen/structosi3_1_1GroundTruth.html[osi3::GroundTruth] message, information about moving and stationary objects is provided from the scenario engine to the sensor model. This entails object positions, orientations, velocities and son on for every simulation time step, but also a so-called model reference. This reference is the path to a 3D asset associated with the object or the stationary environment. Using the pose information together with the 3D mesh data, a _3D environment_ is constructed and updated for every simulation time step. Further attributes, such as https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-antora-generator/asamosi/V3.6.0/gen/structosi3_1_1MovingObject_1_1VehicleAttributes_1_1WheelData.html[wheel positions] for vehicles or https://opensimulationinterface.github.io/osi-antora-generator/asamosi/V3.6.0/gen/structosi3_1_1MovingObject_1_1PedestrianAttributes_1_1Bone.html[bone poses] for pedestrians, enable a more refined movement of traffic participants in the _3D environment_.

.Simulating energy or signal propagation with _3D assets_ linked to material properties
|===
|*Type of use case*         |Technical use case
|*Description*              |As a simulation platform or sensor model developer, I want to simulate the energy or signal propagation using imported _3D assets_ with linked material properties. This is, for example, done with ray tracing. Rays are launched in a virtual 3D scene to simulate the propagation of light beams, radio waves, or ultrasonic waves. The interaction of the rays with the surfaces of the objects in the _3D environment_ depends on the material properties of these surfaces. These properties are assigned to the 3D geometries of the objects and imported from a material database.

The simulation shall be able to cope with different real-time requirements, for example, SiL, HiL, open-loop, closed-loop and so on.
